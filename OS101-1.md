Q1.Explain what is Loose Coupling and Tight Coupling. Also show the examples of code having tight coupling and how you can make it loosely coupled.?

Ans: Loose Coupling: Loose coupling means they are mostly independent. If the only knowledge that class A has
about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and class B are said to be loosely coupled.

Tight Coupling: Tight coupling means the two classes often change together. In other words, if A knows more than
it should about the way in which B was implemented, then A and B are tightly coupled.Example : If you want to change the skin,
you would also have to change the design of your body as well because the two are joined together – they are tightly coupled.
The best example of tight coupling is RMI(Remote Method Invocation)

In order to over come from the problems of tight coupling between objects, spring framework uses dependency injection mechanism with the help of POJO/POJI model and through dependency injection its possible to achieve loose coupling.

// Java program to illustrate
// tight coupling concept
class Volume
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Box b = new Box(5,5,5);
System.out.println(b.volume);
}
}
class Box
{
public int volume;
Box(int length, int width, int height)
{
this.volume = length _ width _ height;
}
}

// Java program to illustrate
// loose coupling concept
public interface Topic
{
void understand();
}
class Topic1 implements Topic {
public void understand()
{
System.out.println("Got it");
}
}
class Topic2 implements Topic {
public void understand()
{
System.out.println("understand");
}
}
public class Subject {
public static void main(String[] args)
{
Topic t = new Topic1();
t.understand();
}
}

Q2:What is High cohesion and how is it helpful?

Ans: We want to design components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose—Cohesion often refers to how the elements of a module belong together. Related code should be close to each other to make it highly cohesive.
Easy to maintain code usually has high cohesion. The elements within the module are directly related to the functionality that module is meant to provide. By keeping high cohesion within our code, we end up trying DRY code and reduce duplication of knowledge in our modules. We can easily design, write, and test our code since the code for a module is all located together and works together.
The original intent of the research from which the concept of cohesion and the associated concept of coupling came from was research into what where the characteristics of programs that were easy to understand, maintain, and extend. The goal was to be able to learn best practices of programming, codify those best practices, and then teach the practices to other programmers.

The goal of good programmers is to write source code whose cohesion is as high as possible given the environment and the problem being solved. This implies that in a large application some parts of the source code body will vary from other parts as to the level of cohesion of the source code in that module or class. Some times about the best you can get is temporal or sequential cohesion due to the problem you are trying to solve.

Q3 State KISS and YAGNI principle

Ans: KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid
The KISS principle is descriptive to keep the code simple and clear, making it easy to understand. After all, programming languages are for humans to understand — computers can only understand 0 and 1 — so keep coding simple and straightforward. Keep your methods small. Each method should never be more than 40-50 lines.

YAGNI Principle
YAGNI stands for You Ain’t Gonna Need It. It’s a principle from software development methodology of Extreme Programming (XP).
This principle says that you should not create features that it’s not really necessary.
This principle it’s similar to the KISS principle, once that both of them aim for a simpler solution. The difference between them it’s
that YAGNI focus on removing unnecessary functionality and logic, and KISS focus on the complexity.
